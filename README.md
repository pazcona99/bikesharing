This involves importing data into Tableau and then creating various style worksheets, dashboards, and a story. The program is built to publish and display data in a professional manner. The data is accurately illustrated in various dashboards that are also interactive and shareable.

# Summary:

The data shows high activity of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August 2019.
The far majority of the rides were in the very busy Manhattan Island, taken by male users during commuting hours. This indicates that CitiBike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers.

Additional analysis could include:

- comparing data for different months to determine trends across the year
- including transportation data to find the flow of the population across different modes of transportation
